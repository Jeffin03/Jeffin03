## Hi, I'm Jeffin Issac 👋

I'm interested in **Cybersecurity, Linux, and DevOps**.

- 🔐 Learning cryptography fundamentals and security tooling
- ⚙️ Working with automation, CI/CD, and GitHub Actions
- 🐚 Writing shell scripts for system tasks and automation
- 🐳 I like using containers to keep development environments isolated and reproducible

Focused on hands-on learning through open-source projects.
